            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A true Relation OF</hi> The Battell at Acton on Saturday laſt.</head>
            <p>ON Friday laſt there was a Rumour of Peace blazed abroad in the City, which was only upon policie to come on unawares, which wee are all ſubject to believe, which cauſes our own Ruine; for we believed that Rumour which made us be unprovided of Men and Arms; ſo they had the advantage of us at the beginning.</p>
            <p>On Saturday they came on our men, who were unprovided both of Powder and Bullets; but the Lord that is the chief fighter, I hope on our ſide will ſtill defend us: For, Colonell <hi>Hollis</hi> with his Regiment did hold them play till the other Forces came in, which did behave themſelves very couragiouſly.</p>
            <p>Alſo, Captain <hi>Manwaring</hi> did with his Troop of Horſe behave himſelf bravely, for he ſtood
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156194:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 51 -->cloſe to it, not being daunted at any thing; for the Lord was their incourager, and brought them on, and brought them off.</p>
            <p>It was almoſt four of the clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon before the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> came to them with his Forces; but when he came, the Lord fought with them, for they were wonderfull couragious in the Battel, for they flew on like Tygers, both with Muſquet, Pike and Sword, till they could ſee no longer; therefore they were forced to leave off for that night; There were about Seven hundred Cavaliers ſlain, with the loſſe of about One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty on our ſide.</p>
            <p>On Sunday morning about ſix of the clock a break of day, they began to fight fiercely on both ſides, but our men came on couragiouſly; the Noble and valorous Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> did play his part very bravely, incouraging his Souldiers to be valorous, knowing whoſe cauſe it is, for God, King and Country.</p>
            <p>Colonell <hi>Hollis</hi> hath ſtood very bravely to it, both on Saturday and Sunday, with an undaunted ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Colonell <hi>Hampden</hi> hath likewiſe been very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in this Battell, the Lord be praiſed that hee continues ſo conſtant, and true hearted for the defence of the Goſpell, they going out with full reſolution to live rnd die in the defence of it, for which we are all bound to pray to the Lord to continue amongſt us. but the Lord is angry
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156194:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 51 -->for our too much neglecting of him and his word, this Land abounds wonderfully in ſinne, and we muſt expect a puniſhment: ſo the Lord begins to puniſh very ſharply, let us all joyn in prayer to other heavier aflictions, and not to make us like unto Germany, we all know that was the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhingſt Lingdom in all Chriſtendome; but the Lord ſent firſt the Sword that devoured many a thouſand, then came the peſtilence, that ſwept away many, then came famine, ſo theſe three together hath made it a depolliſhed Countrey; it is credibly reported that a man may travell a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles and not ſee a Town, nor mnat man wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nor child: the firſt is begun here, but let us all humbly and joyntly together few unto the Lord that he will keep the others from us which we may dayly expect continuing in our ſinne and wickedneſſe; let us now doe as we are bound in duty to do, ſeek to amend nur lives and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and become new creatures, and deſire every one of us to be he or ſhe that may ſtand in the gape to appeaſe the juſt Wrath of the Lord who is the knower of all things before they come to paſſe, and deſire him to unite us all in one, that we may be all of one Church, and of one Reſolution, and that we may not ſtand in oppoſition one againſt another, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fight againſt the child, and the child a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the father, and brother againſt brother, which cauſeth ſo many dead corps to lye on the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156194:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 52 -->ground as now doth, to the great terror and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment of all the beholders, it is a griefe to all to ſee or heare of it, the father and mother grieve for their ſons, the ſons and daughters grieve for their fathers, the wife grieves for the husband, brother grieves for brother, ſo all are weeping and lamenting, none can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce for all ſinart, from the higheſt to the loweſt all are aflicted, but the Lord I hope will in convenient time, bring a period to it.</p>
            <p>It is credibly reported by thoſe that were eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes, that there lyes heaps of dead men in multitudes.</p>
            <p>This was brought from thence on Sunday at three of the clock in the afternoone, and then there were ſlain the Lieutenant Colonell under Colonell <hi>Hollis,</hi> and one Captain <hi>Puſh,</hi> theſe are all of noat, three or four more were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but what Souldiers of each ſide were ſlain is not yet juſtly known for Sundayes ſight.</p>
            <p>On Sarurday laſt at Miles-end-Green, about three of the clock were taken the Earl of Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, the Lord of Dorſets ſon, and Sir <hi>Kellam Digby,</hi> who had been in Kent to raiſe forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament, and in other parts to raiſe more, but the Lord hath ſtopped his journey and hindred his intentions, for in ſtead of going with an Army of men againſt the Parliament, he was with the reſt guarded with Armed men to the Parliament, there to ſuffer according to their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156194:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 52 -->treachery, a juſt reward to ſuch Delinquents, they were committed to cuſtody till they could be examined.</p>
            <p>On Saturday night laſt at 11 of the clock, two Captains went poſt into Eſſex to raiſe men which was quickly done, for there were 500 came into town on Sunday morning about nine of the clock. with undaunted reſolution to march away with the Noble Earl of Warwick, which is Lord Generall of theſe forces for the defence of the King and Parliament, and for the defence of the true Proteſtant Religion, vowing to live and die with the two Noble and Couragious Generalls, which are the two Loadſtones of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>On Saturday the 12. of November, Prince <hi>Robert</hi> uſing the advantage of the Miſt, which was that morning extreamly thick, brought up his Forces to <hi>Brainford,</hi> where he was moſt vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly oppoſed by my Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> Regiment on the Bridge, who beat them off, and with great reſolution maintained the Bridge till they had ſpent all their powder and ſhot, at which time it pleaſed God that Colonell <hi>Hampden</hi> and Colonell <hi>Hollis</hi> Regiments came in, who very manfully ſet upon them, and ſlew many of them, with the loſſe of a very few on our ſide.</p>
            <p>On Sunday the 13. of November no feat of War was done, onely there came up two ſmall Ships to Branford, who hearing the Cavaliers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:156194:5"/>
